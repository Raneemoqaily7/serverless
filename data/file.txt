Serverless offloads all management responsibility for backend cloud infrastructure and operations tasks - provisioning,
 scheduling, scaling, patching and more - to the cloud provider. This gives developers more time to develop 
 and optimize their front-end application code and business logic. And with serverless,
customers never pay for idle capacity. They pay only for the resources required to run their applications,
and only when those applications are running.

The name notwithstanding, there are most definitely servers in serverless computing. 
The term 'serverless' describes the customer's experience with those servers: they are invisible to the customer,
 who doesn't see them, manage them, or interact with them in any way.
