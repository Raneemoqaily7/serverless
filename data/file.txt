As you can see, only major versions are available. That's because Vercel will automatically roll out minor and patch updates if needed (for example in the case that a security issue needs to be fixed).

Defining the node property inside 
engines
 of a package.json file will override the selection made in the Project Settings and print a Build Step warning if the version does not match.
